Code for [Image Analysis for Archival Discovery](http://aida.unl.edu)

Project led by Elizabeth Lorang and Leen-Kiat Soh at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. For other project contributors, past and present, see [our website](http://aida.unl.edu).

Image Analysis for Archival Discovery (Aida) responds to two issues within the digital humanities and digital library communities: First, that we leverage little of the information potential of the millions of images that we are creating as we digitize the cultural record. Second, that locating relevant materials in digital collections is often already a difficult endeavor and will become increasingly so as more content is digitized. We are asking what more we can do with the millions of images that represent the digitized cultural record, and we are interested in the types of discovery that serious attention to digital images might yield. 

Currently, this repository includes our code for retrieving images from Chronicling America and then for segmenting the pages, extracting visual features from the pages, and classifying segments of pages as containing or not containing poetic content.
